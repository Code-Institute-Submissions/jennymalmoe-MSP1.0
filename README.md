This website is created to brand a fitness studio "Absolute Fitness" (referred to "The studio" in readme), to get new members and to keep existing members. The Absolute Fitness's USP is that they are differentiated from other studios because they offer foremost; women a more effective training method (short classes with extremely high-intensity training that produces results quickly, wich also can be used from home. 

Since many trainingstudios, due to Covid-19, have had a hard time keeping and attracting new members, this studio can stand out by offering remote classes and a covid-safe workout studio. 
Also many women nowadays have a hard time finding time for exercise, this kind of training matches their needs as well.

### Strategy 

**Project Goals**

The purpose of this project is to *"Build a website for a gym. ...Build a static front-end site to present useful information to users, using all the technologies that you have learned about so far.

**Homepage:** The user should be able to get a clear understanding (lots of space and not too much information) of what the studio offers (method and prices) and how the user can take part of that (free trial, on demand, at the studio). 

The site is designed to signal energy, high end and modern. The homepage should draw user's attention immediatle (without the need to scroll).

Mockup how the finished site looks on different screen sizes.

### Surface (most concrete, what is seen? Finally, at the level of the surface, we ask the question what will the product actually look like?
Graphics/Mockups/Color
What colors?
What typography are we going to put in place?
What images? What design elements?
Order of things
Sites identity
(content split into two areas tex)
In other words, what will the final product look and feel like?)
### Design Choices

**Colors:** 

**Color Scheme**

I want the site to represent highend and feminine values, with a clear message, and offer. The colors are feminine, warm, inviting, encouraging, and modern. Characteristics that attract women. 

![color_scheme](https://i.imgur.com/3AA6FPC.png)

**Typography**
The Roboto font is the main font used throughout the site with Sans-serif as the fallback font. Roboto was developed to balance content density and reading comfort and is pretty subtle, it doesn´t take any attention away from the content.

**Imagery**
The homepage image is striking and modern. All images is of women bla bla.

**Responsive design**
